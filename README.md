##  Megaklinikka Test

### The solutions for the 2 tests are published here -
    
    1. Test 1 was about writing a JavaScript function. The JavaScript code is embedded in the ```index.html``` file
    2. Test 2 was about building a simple webservice endpoint. I have solved that problem in 2 different ways 
    using 2 frameworks. First one was done with SparkJava and the second one with Flask framework (Python)
